# Tensorflow_crop_import
I built a function to crop out the images detected when using Tensorflow 2.0. This Just crops out each detected image and stores them in file path under the images Name.
Much of this code is heavily modified and it's original source code can be found here https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/utils/visualization_utils.py
I took the time to understand how there functions work and decided to create my own crop function
